# Developer Open API 
Providing developers to use API Interface and continuously updated

#### Software Architecture

 Springcloud + SpringBoot Set up

#### Version is introduced

    ① Developer API
        Providing a stable and secure service interface 
        lets you care about implementing only a small amount of code 
    ② DevelopmentAPI 
         It is different from the Developer API in that it has more functions and power than the Developer API. 
         On the contrary, 
         in order to obtain such power, 
         it is not very stable
         
         
        ★Note that there: 
                           The Developer API is a stable version that you can use for exploration without pursuing more features.
                           The DevelopmentAPI is in the development version and is more buggy and volatile than the developer API
                           We hope you can join our team to build a better API.
